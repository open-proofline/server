Proofline Server is the experimental Go server backend for private encrypted incident capture. It receives already-encrypted recording chunks through authenticated private `/v1` routes, stores metadata in SQLite by default or optional PostgreSQL, keeps encrypted blobs on local disk by default or in optional S3-compatible object storage, exposes private coarse liveness/readiness checks, performs a startup check against optional Valkey/Redis-compatible coordination when explicitly configured, and exposes a token-scoped read-only viewer for incident review.

> Repository role: this repository is the server/backend component only. In the multi-repo layout it is `open-proofline/server`, not the full Proofline product suite.
>
> Artifact note: the Go module path is `github.com/open-proofline/server`, the published GHCR image is `ghcr.io/open-proofline/server`, and release binaries use `proofline-server-*` names. Compatibility identifiers such as the v1 encryption envelope scheme and default SQLite filename may still use earlier `safety-recorder` names until separate protocol or data-layout migrations are explicitly designed.

## Security Warning

> This project is not production-ready public infrastructure. The private `/v1` API now requires local account sessions, and `/admin` requires an admin web session, but both are still private control surfaces and must stay behind localhost, LAN, WireGuard, a firewall, or a strict reverse proxy. Separate bind addresses are a deployment boundary, not a complete security model.

## What It Is

This repository currently contains the Go server backend only. It does not
contain the web client, iOS client, Android client, protocol repository,
account portal, production recording client, or mobile app code. The simulator
may capture or encode local test segments for backend reference flows only.

The intended long-term Proofline product is broader than emergency-only recording: it should support private encrypted incident capture for emergencies, non-emergency interaction records, timed safety checks, and evidence notes.

Future client repositories are expected to record audio/video and supporting metadata in short chunks, encrypt them locally, and upload them continuously so already-uploaded evidence is retained if a phone is lost, damaged, powered off, or taken.

Evidence bundles are ZIP files containing encrypted chunks and JSON manifests. They are not decrypted, playable, or merged media exports.

The simulator encrypts generated chunks by default with the documented v1
AES-256-GCM envelope, can stage local file or ffmpeg test segments in
desktop-recorder mode, and verifies downloaded bundles locally. Keys remain
client-side and are not uploaded to the backend. Future production key custody
is expected to use a hybrid trusted-contact model; see
[docs/key-custody.md](docs/key-custody.md).

Planned production-cluster work is additive. SQLite metadata and local filesystem blob storage remain supported. Optional PostgreSQL metadata, S3-compatible object storage, and Valkey/Redis-compatible coordination are available only when explicitly configured. Complete-upload idempotency is implemented through metadata-backed upload-operation state, while resumable uploads, leases, and operation-level coordination remain future work. See [docs/production-cluster-scope.md](docs/production-cluster-scope.md).

## Planned Open Proofline Repositories

The intended organisation is `open-proofline`, with responsibilities split across repositories:

| Future repository | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `open-proofline/server` | Go backend, private API, private admin web surface, public incident viewer, storage, migrations, deployment docs, and server release workflow. |
| `open-proofline/web-client` | Account portal, authorised incident review, trusted-contact access, and eventual replacement for the current token-only viewer. |
| `open-proofline/ios-client` | iOS incident capture, encrypted staging, upload, local account flows, and platform-specific recording behavior. |
| `open-proofline/android-client` | Android incident capture, encrypted staging, upload, local account flows, and platform-specific recording behavior. |
| `open-proofline/protocol` | Shared API specs, encryption envelope specs, bundle manifests, compatibility matrix, and conformance tests. |

This repository should remain scoped to the server/backend role. Product-level or client-specific work should be documented here only as planning context until the relevant future repository exists.

## Planned Incident Modes

Proofline should separate capture from escalation. A user may want to preserve a private encrypted record without treating every recording as an emergency.

Planned incident categories include:

| Mode | Purpose | Default escalation |
|---|---|---|
| Emergency incident | Active safety risk where trusted contacts may need urgent access. | Trusted-contact alert immediately or after a short configured delay. |
| Interaction record | Non-emergency record of important interactions, such as with police, security, landlords, employers, service providers, or other authorities. | No automatic escalation by default. |
| Safety check | Timed check-in flow for walking home, meeting someone, travel, fieldwork, or other elevated-risk situations. | Trusted contacts alerted if the user misses the check-in. |
| Evidence note | Quick photo, audio, location, or note bundle for damage, harassment, threats, or disputes. | No automatic escalation by default. |

The current backend stores generic incidents by default and can optionally store
`incident_mode`, `capture_profile`, `escalation_policy`, and `sharing_state`
metadata on private incident creation. Those fields are labels only: they do not
grant access, send notifications, change retention, change key custody, expose
trusted-contact workflows, or change public viewer and bundle behavior. See
[docs/incident-modes.md](docs/incident-modes.md).

## What Works Today

- Private authenticated `/v1` write/admin API listener group
- Private unauthenticated `/v1/health/live` and `/v1/health/ready` operator
  checks with coarse backend status only
- Public read-only incident viewer listener group
- Local username/password accounts for regular users and admins
- Opaque server-side sessions with expiry and revocation
- Private admin-only HTML surface under `/admin` for bootstrap, login, local
  account listing, and password workflows
- SQLite metadata and local disk encrypted blob storage by default
- Optional PostgreSQL metadata backend for new deployments
- Optional S3-compatible encrypted blob storage for committed chunks
- Immutable chunk uploads with SHA-256 verification
- `Idempotency-Key` support for equivalent complete chunk upload retries
- Private duplicate chunk reconciliation for comparing accepted metadata with
  an expected chunk fingerprint
- Optional incident-mode, capture-profile, escalation-policy, and sharing-state
  metadata on private incident create/read routes
- Documented client-side chunk encryption envelope
- Media streams with `open`, `complete`, and `failed` states
- Completed encrypted stream and incident ZIP evidence bundle downloads
- Scoped viewer tokens with a default 24-hour expiry
- App-level public viewer rate limiting by safe route class, with local
  in-memory counters by default and optional Valkey/Redis-compatible counters
  when coordination is explicitly configured
- Validated backend-selection config defaults for SQLite metadata, optional PostgreSQL metadata, local encrypted blobs, optional S3-compatible encrypted blobs, no coordination by default, and optional Valkey/Redis-compatible coordination
- Simulator CLI for encrypted upload, check-in, stream completion, bundle
  download/decrypt-verification, and durable desktop-recorder staging flows
- Docker image build and GitHub Actions / GHCR publishing

## What It Is Not Yet

- No iOS app
- No Android app
- No web client or account portal
- No protocol repository or shared conformance test suite
- No production recording client implementation
- No mode-driven access, notification, retention, sharing, trusted-contact,
  key-custody, or viewer behavior
- No production client-side encryption implementation
- No implemented resumable, partial, or leased cluster-safe upload protocol
- No implemented live or partial stream chunk access before stream completion
- No backend/browser decryption, key sharing, server escrow, break-glass key access, or playable media export
- No push notifications, SMS, or Messenger integration
- No OAuth, JWT, public account portal, or public admin dashboard
- No built-in TLS, mode-specific retention policy, backup lifecycle enforcement, or production deployment hardening
- No emergency-services integration; users or trusted contacts remain responsible for contacting emergency services

## Architecture

Proofline Server runs separate private and public HTTP listener groups from the same Go binary. Private `/v1` routes handle authenticated writes and admin-style API operations, with unauthenticated private-only health/readiness exceptions for local operator checks. The same private listener also serves the admin-only HTML surface under `/admin`. Public viewer routes are token-gated and read-only.

For more diagrams and package-level details, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [docs/code-map.md](docs/code-map.md). The planned cluster expansion is documented separately in [docs/production-cluster-scope.md](docs/production-cluster-scope.md).

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Go 1.26.3
- SQLite via the bundled Go SQLite driver dependency
- Local disk storage for encrypted uploaded blobs by default

Run the backend:

```bash
SAFE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET='replace-with-local-bootstrap-secret' \
go run ./cmd/api
```

By default this starts:

| Listener | Address |
|---|---|
| Private API | `127.0.0.1:8080` |
| Public incident viewer | `127.0.0.1:8081` |

The private admin web surface is available on the private listener at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin`.

In another terminal, create the first admin account:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/bootstrap/admin \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Proofline-Bootstrap-Secret: replace-with-local-bootstrap-secret' \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"replace-with-a-long-local-password"}'
```

Stop the server, remove `SAFE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET`, and start it again. The
bootstrap route is disabled once an admin account exists.

In another terminal, run the simulator:

```bash
PROOFLINE_SIM_USERNAME=admin \
PROOFLINE_SIM_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-long-local-password' \
go run ./cmd/simclient --chunks 5 --interval 1s --download-bundle
```

The simulator creates an incident, creates a viewer token without printing the
token-bearing viewer URL, encrypts and uploads test chunks into a media stream,
sends checkins, completes the stream, downloads the encrypted bundle, and
verifies local decryption. See [docs/simulator.md](docs/simulator.md) for
encrypted bundle output, offline bundle verification, the durable
desktop-recorder mode, local file input, ffmpeg segment capture, and
poor-network retry controls, and simulator-only contact-wrapped key metadata
artifacts.

## Docker

Build from the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t proofline-server .
```

Run with local-only port publishing and a named data volume:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e SAFE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET='replace-with-local-bootstrap-secret' \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8081:8081 \
  -v proofline-server-data:/data \
  proofline-server
```

Use `POST /v1/bootstrap/admin` to create the first admin account, then restart
the container without `SAFE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET`.

Container defaults bind to `0.0.0.0` inside the container. Restrict host exposure with port publishing, firewall rules, WireGuard, or a reverse proxy. See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).

## AI-Assisted Development

This project has been developed with substantial assistance from OpenAI Codex.

Codex has been used to draft, refactor, test, document, and review parts of the Go backend and Markdown documentation. All accepted changes are reviewed, tested, and committed by the maintainer.

AI assistance does not replace human responsibility. The maintainer remains responsible for:

- code correctness
- security review
- licensing decisions
- release decisions
- deployment choices
- any real-world use of the software

Use of Codex does not imply endorsement, audit, certification, or maintenance by OpenAI.

## Backlog workflow

Use `80-backlog-scan-issue-drafts.md` to generate reviewed local issue drafts under a branch-scoped directory such as `.backlog-drafts/YYYY-MM-DD/<branch-slug>/`.

Review those drafts manually before creating GitHub issues. Drafts are generated review artifacts, not the long-term source of truth once GitHub issues exist.

Only after review, use `85-create-github-issues-from-drafts.md` to generate `scripts/create-backlog-issues.sh` and `.backlog-drafts/.../create-issues-review.md`. Do not run the generated script unless the maintainer explicitly asks for issue creation.

Do not let Codex create GitHub issues directly during the initial scan.

## Security

Viewer links and `/v1` session tokens are bearer credentials and should be treated as secrets. Public deployment still needs TLS, rate limiting, log review, proxy hardening, operational testing, and deployment-specific retention, backup, and deletion enforcement. Do not expose `/v1` publicly as-is.

Please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for supported versions and vulnerability reporting guidance. Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

## Roadmap

- Create future `open-proofline/web-client`, `open-proofline/ios-client`, `open-proofline/android-client`, and `open-proofline/protocol` repositories when their scopes are ready
- Plan any future protocol or data-layout compatibility migrations separately from the completed repository/module/artifact rename
- Continue hardening optional PostgreSQL metadata support while preserving SQLite local/default support
- Wire optional Valkey/Redis-compatible coordination into future leases and retry handling without making it durable evidence storage
- Complete the remaining cluster-safe upload operation semantics before multi-node production deployment
- Keep cluster backup, restore, and failure runbooks current as optional PostgreSQL, S3-compatible storage, and coordination behavior evolve
- WireGuard-only bind/firewall deployment guidance
- Mode-driven access, escalation, retention, sharing, viewer, and key-custody
  behavior after protocol and security design
- Server-side support for trusted-contact dead-man switch workflows after access-control design
- Production key custody, trusted-contact access, and browser/client-side decryption
- Optional break-glass/dead-man-switch key access
- Playable media export
- Reverse-proxy/TLS hardening for incident viewer exposure
- Explicit [`/v1` access-control story](docs/v1-access-control.md) before any public product API deployment
