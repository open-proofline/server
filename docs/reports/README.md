# Reports

This directory contains public technical review artifacts for Proofline.
Reports are documentation and planning inputs, not formal audits,
certifications, or production-readiness endorsements.

Historical reports keep their original `Safety Recorder` titles, filenames, and reviewed-commit context because they describe the project before the docs-only Proofline rename.
