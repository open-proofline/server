# Getting Started

This guide starts the Proofline backend locally and runs the simulator against it.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26.3
- SQLite through the bundled Go SQLite driver dependency
- PostgreSQL only when explicitly using `SAFE_METADATA_BACKEND=postgresql`
- Local disk storage for encrypted uploaded blobs

## Run The Backend

From the repository root:

```bash
SAFE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET='replace-with-local-bootstrap-secret' \
go run ./cmd/api
```

Default listeners:

| Listener | Default address |
|---|---|
| Private API | `127.0.0.1:8080` |
| Public incident viewer | `127.0.0.1:8081` |

The private admin web surface is available at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin`. When `SAFE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` is set and no
admin exists, that page shows the first-admin bootstrap screen; after an admin
exists, it shows the admin login screen and local account password workflows.

The backend writes local data under `./data` by default:

```text
data/
  safety.db
  tmp/
  incidents/{incident_id}/streams/{stream_id}/{media_type}_{zero_padded_chunk_index}.enc
  incidents/{incident_id}/{media_type}_{zero_padded_chunk_index}.enc
```

The database file name still uses `safety.db` until a separate artifact/data-layout migration is performed.

Uploads are staged in `tmp/`, hashed while streaming, and then hard-linked into the final incident path without overwriting existing chunk files. Streamed uploads use the stream-scoped path; the incident-level path remains for legacy unstreamed chunks.

For a new local database, create the first admin account before running the
simulator:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/bootstrap/admin \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Proofline-Bootstrap-Secret: replace-with-local-bootstrap-secret' \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"replace-with-a-long-local-password"}'
```

Then restart the server without `SAFE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET`.

## Run The Simulator

In another terminal from the repository root:

```bash
PROOFLINE_SIM_USERNAME=admin \
PROOFLINE_SIM_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-long-local-password' \
go run ./cmd/simclient --chunks 5 --interval 1s --download-bundle
```

The simulator:

- logs in with a local account session
- creates an incident
- creates an incident viewer token using the current incident-token route
- creates an audio media stream
- encrypts fake chunk plaintext and uploads the ciphertext envelope with `stream_id`
- sends periodic checkins
- marks the stream complete
- downloads the completed encrypted stream bundle through the incident viewer when requested
- verifies local decryption of the downloaded bundle when encryption is enabled

The simulator exercises the current generic incident API. It does not implement planned incident modes such as emergency incidents, interaction records, safety checks, or evidence notes.
