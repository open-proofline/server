# iOS Local Recorder Prototype Plan

This document scopes a future iOS local recorder prototype. It is a planning
document only. It does not add iOS code, Swift packages, backend routes,
database schema, key custody implementation, browser decryption, backend
decryption, push notifications, SMS, Messenger integration, user accounts,
OAuth, JWT, or public `/v1` authentication.

The prototype should prove that a native iOS client can record locally, encrypt
chunks before upload, stage encrypted chunks durably, retry uploads, and map its
local state to the current backend media stream APIs. The Go simulator remains
the backend reference flow until a real client exists.

## Prototype Goal

Build the smallest useful native iOS recorder that exercises the current Safety
Recorder backend contract:

- create or resume one incident through the private `/v1` API
- create one media stream per local recording track
- record short chunks locally
- encrypt each chunk before upload
- store only encrypted staged chunks durably
- upload chunks with stream-local positive indexes
- retry failed uploads without mutating accepted chunks
- complete or fail streams explicitly
- keep enough local metadata to recover after app restart

The first prototype should be audio-first. Video capture can be added as a
foreground-only track after the audio chunk, staging, and retry loop is proven.
Location and device checkins can use the existing checkin API as supporting
metadata, but they are not required for the first recorder milestone.

## Non-Goals

- No production-ready safety app claim.
- No stealth or hidden recording behavior.
- No public exposure of the private `/v1` API.
- No backend decryption or server-held raw media keys.
- No key escrow, browser decryption, trusted-contact implementation, or
  break-glass implementation.
- No playable media export.
- No cloud service dependency.
- No notification, SMS, or Messenger integration.
- No user account, OAuth, JWT, or public admin model.

## Current Backend Contract

The prototype should follow the streamed upload path documented in
[api.md](api.md):

1. `POST /v1/incidents`
2. `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams`
3. `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/chunks` with:
   - `stream_id`
   - positive `chunk_index` starting at `1`
   - `media_type`
   - `started_at`
   - `ended_at`
   - `sha256_hex` of the complete ciphertext envelope bytes
   - `file` containing encrypted bytes
4. `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams/{stream_id}/complete` with
   `expected_chunk_count`
5. `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams/{stream_id}/fail` when local
   recording cannot produce a complete contiguous stream

Streamed chunk identity is `(incident_id, stream_id, chunk_index)`. Chunk
indexes are stream-local and must be contiguous for stream completion. Accepted
chunks are immutable. The client must never overwrite a staged chunk in place or
attempt to replace a chunk the backend has accepted.

The emergency viewer and bundle download paths are read-only and should not be
used by the recorder except for manual development checks.

## Recorder Behavior

The prototype should expose a plain start/stop recording flow:

- request microphone permission before starting audio capture
- request camera permission only if the foreground video track is enabled
- show whether the recorder is idle, recording, retrying uploads, stopping, or
  failed
- create an incident when recording begins, or resume a locally known open
  incident after restart
- create an audio stream before the first audio chunk upload
- optionally create a separate video stream before foreground video chunk upload
- persist the current incident ID, stream IDs, next chunk indexes, and staged
  upload queue
- keep recording and upload concerns separated so recording can continue while
  older encrypted chunks are retried

For the first milestone, do not require emergency token sharing from the iOS
app. A development-only option to create a token may be useful later, but token
sharing is not necessary to prove local recording, encryption, staging, and
upload semantics.

## Chunking Cadence

Use short, fixed-duration chunks so already-uploaded evidence remains useful if
the device is lost, damaged, powered off, or taken.

Recommended prototype defaults:

| Media type | Initial cadence | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `audio` | 5 seconds | Primary first prototype stream. |
| `video` | 5 seconds | Foreground-only follow-up track. |
| `location` | 10 to 30 seconds | Prefer checkins first; chunked location can wait. |
| `metadata` | event-driven | Use only for structured client events if needed. |

The cadence should be configurable in development builds, but production-facing
defaults should stay boring and predictable. Each chunk should carry UTC
`started_at` and `ended_at` timestamps that match the captured media interval as
closely as practical.

The client should finish and stage the current chunk before moving to the next
index. If a recording interruption prevents a chunk from being finalized, the
client should not synthesize a successful placeholder. It should either retry
finalization locally or mark the stream failed with a clear local reason.

## Local Encrypted Staging

The client should persist only encrypted chunk envelopes in its durable staging
queue. Plain capture output may exist briefly in a temporary file or memory
buffer while the chunk is finalized and encrypted, but it should be deleted as
soon as encryption and ciphertext hash calculation succeed.

Each staged chunk record should include:

- incident ID
- stream ID
- media type
- chunk index
- UTC start and end timestamps
- ciphertext byte size
- ciphertext SHA-256 hex
- local encrypted file path or file identifier
- upload attempt count
- last upload error category
- upload status: `pending`, `uploading`, `uploaded`, or `abandoned`

Staged encrypted chunk files are immutable. If encryption must be retried before
upload, create a new staged file and metadata record before discarding the old
failed staging attempt. Once a staged chunk has been uploaded successfully, keep
enough local metadata to avoid reusing its chunk index after app restart. Local
retention of uploaded encrypted staging files can be a prototype setting, but
deletion must not imply deletion from the backend.

Use iOS file protection and Keychain settings deliberately during
implementation. The prototype should record which protection class was chosen
and how it behaves when the device is locked. Do not treat the initial prototype
choice as the production key custody answer.

## Encryption And Key Assumptions

The backend currently stores opaque ciphertext only. The iOS prototype must
encrypt chunks before upload and compute `sha256_hex` over the encrypted
envelope bytes. It should not upload raw media, raw media keys, plaintext,
Keychain secrets, or recovery material.

For the first prototype:

- use a stable Apple cryptography API such as CryptoKit for AES-GCM
- use a fresh nonce for every encrypted chunk
- bind the same associated-data fields used by the documented v1 envelope:
  incident ID, stream ID, media type, and positive chunk index
- prefer a per-stream media key for new iOS work
- store prototype keys in the iOS Keychain with documented access behavior
- never log raw keys, plaintext, ciphertext bytes, request bodies, or emergency
  tokens

This is still not the final production key custody model. Production work must
align with [key-custody.md](key-custody.md), which assumes the iPhone may be
unavailable and recommends a future hybrid trusted-contact model. If the
prototype stores keys only on the device, document that as a prototype
availability limitation rather than a production decision.

## Upload And Retry Behavior

The upload queue should treat recording and network upload as separate loops.
Recording should continue staging encrypted chunks while upload retries proceed
in the background when iOS allows execution.

Retry expectations:

- retry transient network failures with bounded exponential backoff
- keep retries per chunk ordered by stream index unless a later design proves
  out-of-order upload is safe for the client UX
- do not mutate staged ciphertext when retrying an upload
- on `400 hash_mismatch`, treat the local staged record as corrupt and stop
  retrying that chunk until the user or developer can inspect it
- on `400 invalid_chunk_index`, `400 invalid_media_type`, or time-range errors,
  treat the local metadata as a client bug
- on `409 duplicate_chunk`, reconcile against local state before deciding that
  the upload already succeeded
- on `409 stream_not_open`, stop uploads for that stream and surface a local
  stream-state error
- on `413 upload_too_large`, reduce the chunk duration or encoded bitrate for
  future chunks; do not split or rewrite the already staged immutable chunk
- on `5xx` or network loss, keep the chunk pending for retry

Stream completion should happen only after all chunks from `1` through
`expected_chunk_count` are locally marked uploaded. If the app cannot produce a
contiguous stream, it should call the stream failure endpoint instead of forcing
completion.

## Background And Foreground Constraints

The prototype should measure iOS lifecycle behavior instead of assuming the app
can run indefinitely.

Audio:

- design audio as the first prototype track
- configure an audio session for recording before capture starts
- test foreground recording, screen lock, interruption, route change, and app
  backgrounding behavior
- document whether the app has the required background audio capability enabled
  for the test build

Video:

- treat video as foreground-only in the prototype plan
- assume camera capture can be interrupted or unavailable when the app is
  backgrounded or the device is locked
- if video stops but audio continues, complete or fail the video stream
  separately from the audio stream

Uploads:

- use normal foreground uploads while the app is active
- use background-capable URL loading only if it can be kept simple and testable
- persist the queue before starting uploads so an app kill or reboot can resume
  safely
- do not require upload completion before staging the next recording chunk

## Failure Modes To Test

The prototype should include manual or automated test notes for these cases:

| Failure mode | Expected behavior |
|---|---|
| Network unavailable at start | Record and stage encrypted chunks locally; upload later. |
| Network drops during upload | Keep staged chunk immutable and retry. |
| Backend unavailable | Keep recording until local limits are reached; retry later. |
| App backgrounds during audio | Continue only if configured and observed to work; otherwise finalize or fail stream. |
| App backgrounds during video | Stop, complete, or fail the video stream; do not assume background camera capture. |
| Device locks | Record observed audio behavior; treat video as interrupted. |
| App is killed | Resume from local incident, stream, queue, and next chunk index metadata. |
| Device reboots | Resume only from persisted encrypted staging and metadata. |
| Chunk encryption fails | Do not upload plaintext; mark local chunk failed. |
| Hash mismatch response | Treat staged ciphertext or metadata as corrupt; do not blindly retry forever. |
| Duplicate chunk response | Reconcile with local uploaded state before proceeding. |
| Stream completion rejected | Keep stream local state inspectable and do not delete staged evidence. |
| Local storage full | Stop recording safely, preserve staged encrypted chunks, and surface failure. |
| Permission revoked | Stop affected track and fail or complete its stream according to contiguous chunks. |

## Backend API Gaps

Do not implement these as part of the prototype plan. Track them as future
backend issues if they become necessary:

- no app-level `/v1` authentication or authorization suitable for public
  networks
- no client API for reconciling a duplicate chunk by expected ciphertext hash
- no explicit resumable-upload protocol for partially sent large chunks
- no endpoint for client-side local queue summaries or upload leases
- no API for registering or storing contact-wrapped media keys
- no production key custody, recovery, or trusted-contact decryption API
- no server-side retention or incident deletion API
- no endpoint for live partial-stream bundle viewing before stream completion
- no first-class upload telemetry endpoint for client storage pressure,
  interruption reasons, or retry state

For the first prototype, avoid expanding the backend unless a gap blocks the
basic simulator-equivalent flow.

## Validation Plan

Before iOS implementation starts:

- review this plan against [api.md](api.md), [encryption.md](encryption.md),
  [simulator.md](simulator.md), and [key-custody.md](key-custody.md)
- run the simulator smoke test as the backend reference flow:

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/simclient --chunks 5 --interval 1s --download-bundle
```

During prototype implementation:

- verify audio chunks upload with positive stream-local indexes
- verify downloaded stream bundles can be decrypted locally with the prototype
  key material
- verify app restart does not reuse chunk indexes
- verify network loss leaves encrypted chunks staged for retry
- verify failed, interrupted, and completed streams map correctly to backend
  states

Go tests are not required for this planning document unless backend code changes.
