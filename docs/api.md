# API

This is the current backend-only v0.2.1 HTTP surface. The API binary starts private API listeners and public emergency viewer listeners on one or more configured bind addresses. The `/v1` routes are private and unauthenticated. The emergency viewer routes are token-gated and read-only. The planned iOS recording client is not part of this repository yet.

Media bundle downloads are encrypted chunk bundles. The backend does not decrypt, merge, or produce playable media.

Default bind addresses:

- private API server: `127.0.0.1:8080`
- public emergency viewer server: `127.0.0.1:8081`

Use `SAFE_PRIVATE_BIND_ADDRS` and `SAFE_PUBLIC_BIND_ADDRS` for comma-separated bind-address lists. The older singular variables remain supported when the matching plural variable is unset.

## Common Responses

Errors use:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_json",
    "message": "request body must be valid JSON"
  }
}
```

Non-upload JSON bodies are limited to 64 KiB. Upload file bytes are limited by `SAFE_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`; multipart metadata has a small fixed overhead allowance.

## Incidents

Incident routes are mounted only on the private API server.

### `POST /v1/incidents`

Creates an open incident.

Request:

```json
{
  "client_label": "iphone",
  "notes": "test incident"
}
```

Response `201`:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "inc_...",
  "status": "open"
}
```

### `GET /v1/incidents/{incident_id}`

Returns incident metadata, chunk metadata, and checkins. Chunk file bytes are not included.

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "incident": {
    "id": "inc_...",
    "created_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z",
    "status": "open",
    "client_label": "iphone"
  },
  "streams": [],
  "chunks": [],
  "checkins": []
}
```

### `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/close`

Marks an incident closed. Later chunk uploads return `409 incident_closed`.

Response `200` is the updated incident object.

## Chunks

Chunk routes are mounted only on the private API server.

### `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/chunks`

Uploads one already-encrypted chunk as `multipart/form-data`.

Fields:

- `file`: encrypted chunk bytes
- `stream_id`: optional media stream ID for new clients
- `chunk_index`: non-negative integer
- `media_type`: `audio`, `video`, `location`, or `metadata`
- `started_at`: RFC3339 timestamp
- `ended_at`: RFC3339 timestamp, not before `started_at`
- `sha256_hex`: lowercase SHA-256 hex of the encrypted bytes
- `original_filename`: optional display metadata

Response `201`:

```json
{
  "id": "chk_...",
  "incident_id": "inc_...",
  "stream_id": "str_...",
  "chunk_index": 1,
  "media_type": "audio",
  "started_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z",
  "ended_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:10Z",
  "original_filename": "chunk.enc",
  "stored_path": "incidents/inc_.../audio_000001.enc",
  "byte_size": 23,
  "sha256_hex": "...",
  "created_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:11Z"
}
```

When `stream_id` is provided, the stream must exist, belong to the same incident, be open, and have the same `media_type` as the uploaded chunk. Uploads to completed or failed streams return `409 stream_not_open`.

`stream_id` remains optional for backwards compatibility with existing chunks and clients. Unstreamed chunks are still stored and listed, but they are not included in completed-stream bundle downloads.

The current chunk identity remains `(incident_id, media_type, chunk_index)`, so clients should keep chunk indexes unique per incident and media type even when using streams.

Duplicate `(incident_id, media_type, chunk_index)` uploads return `409 duplicate_chunk`. Hash mismatches return `400 hash_mismatch` and do not commit a final file.

### `GET /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/chunks`

Lists chunk metadata for one incident.

### `GET /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/chunks/{media_type}/{chunk_index}`

Returns encrypted chunk bytes as `application/octet-stream`. This route is private/dev-only and is not used by the emergency viewer.

## Media Streams

Media stream routes are mounted only on the private API server.

### `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams`

Creates an open media stream for an incident.

Request:

```json
{
  "media_type": "audio",
  "label": "main audio recording"
}
```

Response `201`:

```json
{
  "stream": {
    "id": "str_...",
    "incident_id": "inc_...",
    "media_type": "audio",
    "label": "main audio recording",
    "status": "open",
    "created_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Invalid media types return `400 invalid_media_type`.

### `GET /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams`

Lists media streams for an incident.

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "streams": []
}
```

### `GET /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams/{stream_id}`

Returns one stream as:

```json
{
  "stream": {
    "id": "str_...",
    "incident_id": "inc_...",
    "media_type": "audio",
    "status": "open",
    "created_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams/{stream_id}/complete`

Marks an open stream complete after verifying chunks `1..expected_chunk_count` exist contiguously and each stored file is readable.

Request:

```json
{
  "expected_chunk_count": 12
}
```

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "stream": {
    "id": "str_...",
    "incident_id": "inc_...",
    "media_type": "audio",
    "status": "complete",
    "expected_chunk_count": 12,
    "completed_at": "2026-05-21T10:02:00Z",
    "created_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-05-21T10:02:00Z"
  }
}
```

Missing or non-contiguous chunks return `409 stream_chunks_incomplete` or `409 stream_chunks_not_contiguous`. Completing an already complete or failed stream returns `409`.

### `POST /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams/{stream_id}/fail`

Marks an open stream failed while preserving uploaded chunks.

Request:

```json
{
  "failure_reason": "client stopped recording unexpectedly"
}
```

Response `200` is the updated stream object with `status: "failed"` and `failed_at` set.

### `GET /v1/incidents/{incident_id}/streams/{stream_id}/download`

Downloads a completed stream as a ZIP bundle. Open or failed streams return `409 stream_not_complete`.

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "incident": {
    "id": "inc_...",
    "status": "open",
    "client_label": "iphone",
    "created_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "latest_checkin": null,
  "chunk_count_by_media_type": {},
  "latest_chunk_by_media_type": {},
  "media": [
    {
      "media_type": "audio",
      "chunk_count": 0
    },
    {
      "media_type": "video",
      "chunk_count": 0
    },
    {
      "media_type": "location",
      "chunk_count": 0

  "completed_streams": [],
  "warning": "If you are concerned about immediate safety, call emergency services now.",
  "generated_at": "2026-05-21T10:00:12Z"
}
```

Emergency viewer responses include `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and a strict `Content-Security-Policy` with `frame-ancestors 'none'`. Token-protected pages, JSON, errors, and downloads include `Cache-Control: no-store`. Invalid, expired, and revoked tokens all return `404 emergency_token_invalid`.

The Go app does not set `Strict-Transport-Security` in local/dev HTTP mode. Set HSTS at the HTTPS reverse proxy or deployment edge for production hostnames.

### `GET /e/{token}/streams/{stream_id}/download`

Downloads a completed stream bundle for the token's incident. The route is read-only and never accepts a client-provided file path. Invalid, expired, and revoked tokens return `404 emergency_token_invalid`.

### `GET /e/{token}/incident/download`

Downloads all completed streams for the token's incident as one encrypted evidence ZIP. Failed/open streams and legacy unstreamed chunks are omitted.
