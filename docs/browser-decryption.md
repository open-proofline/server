# Browser-Side Incident Viewer Decryption

This document is a design spike for future browser/client-side incident viewer decryption in Proofline. It does not implement browser decryption, JavaScript cryptography, new routes, database schema changes, or backend behavior changes.

## Summary

Browser-side decryption could let a trusted contact or authorised user open an incident viewer, download encrypted evidence, and decrypt it locally without exposing raw media keys to the backend during normal operation. This fits the broader hybrid key custody direction:

- recording clients encrypt media before upload
- uploaded chunks remain ciphertext on the backend
- keys are not stored solely on the user's phone
- trusted contacts can access authorised evidence when the phone is unavailable
- browser decryption is one possible trusted-contact or account-owner access path
- server escrow and break-glass access remain separate explicit design paths

The browser path is attractive because it can be available from a normal web link. It is not a complete end-to-end security answer when the same backend can serve or alter the JavaScript that performs decryption.

Planned incident modes include emergency incidents, interaction records, safety checks, and evidence notes. Browser decryption must not assume every authorised incident is an emergency or that all decrypted output should be shared urgently.

## Current Viewer Behaviour

The current incident viewer is token-scoped and read-only. Public routes are mounted only on the public incident viewer listener, not on the private `/v1` listener.

Current behavior:

- `GET /i/{token}` renders a read-only HTML summary after token validation.
- `GET /i/{token}/data` returns the same summary as JSON for polling.
- Static CSS and JavaScript are served from embedded files under `/static/`.
- The page shows incident status, latest checkin, chunk counts, and completed recording download links.
- Completed stream and incident downloads are encrypted ZIP evidence bundles.
- Bundle ZIP entry names are controlled by the server.
- Bundle manifests do not include stored filesystem paths or decryption keys.
- There is no browser decryption today.

The current JavaScript only builds download links and polls the JSON endpoint. It does not parse bundles, handle keys, decrypt chunks, or display plaintext.

The current API uses incident-token terminology for token-scoped public viewer access. Future web-client and protocol work may replace this with broader account or incident-viewer access grants.

## Candidate Approaches

### 1. URL Fragment Decryption Capability

The viewer URL carries a decryption capability in the fragment, for example `/i/{token}#key=...` or a future structured fragment. The HTTP request sends only `/i/{token}` to the server. JavaScript running in the browser reads the fragment and uses it to unwrap or import the media key.

Strengths:

- one link can carry both read access and decryption capability
- no separate file or contact-key setup is required for the simplest version
- useful for early prototypes and manual recovery workflows

Weaknesses:

- fragment secrets can leak through screenshots, copy/paste, browser history behavior, extensions, local compromise, or user error
- malicious JavaScript served by a compromised backend can read the fragment
- if the fragment carries the raw media key, anyone with the full URL can decrypt
- fragment delivery does not solve trusted-contact revocation or key rotation

Fit: useful as a transitional or recovery mechanism, but too weak as the only long-term trusted-contact model.

### 2. Contact Private Key Stored Or Imported In Browser

Each trusted contact has a private key. The incident viewer downloads contact-wrapped media keys and asks the browser to import or use the contact private key to unwrap them. The key may be stored locally by the browser, imported from a file, or provided through a platform credential mechanism.

Strengths:

- aligns with the hybrid trusted-contact model
- avoids making the viewer link alone sufficient to decrypt
- can support contact revocation for future incidents by stopping new wrapping

Weaknesses:

- a compromised browser or device can steal the contact private key
- malicious viewer JavaScript can exfiltrate imported keys or plaintext
- browser private-key storage and backup behavior may be confusing
- contact key loss can make evidence unavailable to that contact

Fit: strong long-term fit if setup happens before an emergency or safety check and the contact UX is simple under stress.

The simulator-only wrapped-key metadata design in
[contact-wrapped-key-metadata-simulator.md](contact-wrapped-key-metadata-simulator.md)
can prototype the non-secret key IDs and wrapped media-key records that a future
browser or trusted-contact client would consume. That prototype does not add
browser decryption or change the current incident viewer.

### 3. One-Time Recovery Phrase Or File Import

The trusted contact or account owner receives a recovery phrase, QR code, or key file through an out-of-band process. During authorised access, the browser imports that material and uses it to unwrap or derive the media key.

Strengths:

- does not require the contact to have preinstalled software
- can work when contact public-key enrollment was not completed
- simple enough for a manual disaster-recovery path

Weaknesses:

- phrases and files are easy to copy, photograph, lose, or store insecurely
- phishing and fake viewer pages are a significant risk
- malicious viewer JavaScript can steal imported recovery material
- passphrase-derived approaches require careful KDF choices and must not use custom cryptography

Fit: useful as a fallback or early prototype, but risky as the primary model unless the recovery material is strongly protected and clearly explained.

### 4. Separate Trusted Contact App

A native or separately distributed trusted contact app receives the viewer token or future access grant, downloads encrypted evidence, and performs decryption outside the web viewer. The web viewer may still show metadata and download links.

Strengths:

- reduces reliance on JavaScript served by the same backend
- can use platform key storage and signed app distribution
- may handle large files, background work, and local secure storage better than a browser

Weaknesses:

- users must install and trust another app before or during an emergency
- app distribution, updates, signing, and platform support become operational requirements
- phishing and token-sharing problems still exist

Fit: good for higher assurance, but poor if contacts have not installed or prepared the app before the access event.

### 5. Static/Signed Viewer Bundle

The decrypting viewer is a static bundle with a pinned release, signature, hash, or independent hosting path. Contacts use that viewer to fetch encrypted evidence and decrypt locally. The goal is to reduce trust in dynamic JavaScript served by the incident backend.

Strengths:

- can improve confidence that the viewer code is the reviewed release
- supports offline or separately hosted verification paths
- can be paired with contact-wrapped keys

Weaknesses:

- signature/hash verification is hard to make understandable during stressful access
- if the backend still serves the viewer, compromise can replace the page unless the contact has an independent verification route
- browser and device compromise remain in scope
- cross-origin and CORS design may complicate deployment

Fit: promising as a mitigation for malicious-server risk, but it needs careful UX.

### 6. Browser Decryption Deferred In Favour Of Non-Browser Client

The project documents browser limitations and prioritizes a native trusted contact client or offline decrypt tool before adding browser decryption.

Strengths:

- avoids shipping security-sensitive browser crypto before the key custody model is settled
- gives time to design contact keys, wrapping, and live stream sessions
- can produce a higher-assurance decrypt path first

Weaknesses:

- trusted contacts may have a harder time accessing evidence quickly
- non-browser clients still need distribution, updates, and support
- deferral does not solve emergency availability by itself

Fit: reasonable if the project values assurance over immediate web convenience, but it delays the easiest contact access path.

## Incident Mode Implications

Browser decryption UX should reflect why the incident was captured:

| Incident mode | Browser decryption implication |
|---|---|
| Emergency incident | Trusted contacts may need simple urgent access and clear emergency-services guidance. |
| Interaction record | Access should default to private/account-owner review; sharing should be deliberate and non-urgent. |
| Safety check | Missed check-ins may trigger trusted-contact access, but false positives need careful wording and cancellation/audit policy. |
| Evidence note | Often a controlled export/review workflow rather than live emergency access. |

Do not hard-code emergency language into all decrypting viewer flows. A future web client should distinguish urgent safety review from ordinary authorised incident review.

## URL Fragment Model

URL fragments are not sent in normal HTTP requests. In a URL such as `https://example.test/i/token#key=value`, the browser requests `/i/token` and keeps `#key=value` client-side. That can keep key material out of backend HTTP handlers, reverse-proxy access logs, and referrer paths.

JavaScript running on the page can read the fragment locally through browser APIs. A future viewer could import a fragment-carried key, use it to unwrap or import a media key, then remove the fragment from the visible location bar after import.

Fragments are still sensitive. They can leak through:

- screenshots or screen sharing
- copy/pasted URLs
- browser history behavior
- browser extensions
- local malware or device compromise
- malicious JavaScript served by the viewer origin
- user support transcripts or logs

Fragment keys are therefore not a complete solution against a compromised server. If the server can serve modified JavaScript, that JavaScript can read the fragment and send it away. Fragment delivery mainly helps against passive request logging and passive server storage compromise.

## Malicious Server Limitation

Browser decryption served by the same backend is useful against passive storage, database, and blob compromise. It is not full end-to-end protection against a malicious or compromised server that can serve modified JavaScript.

Possible mitigations:

- strict CSP
- static assets
- no inline script
- Subresource Integrity where applicable
- signed or static viewer bundle
- separate trusted viewer app
- pinned viewer release
- offline verification/decryption tool

These mitigations help, but they do not erase the core limitation. If the backend controls the HTML and JavaScript delivered at access time, a fully compromised backend can try to alter the decrypting code, hide warnings, or capture keys and plaintext. Higher-assurance designs need an independently verified client, signed static release, or offline decrypt path.

## Web Crypto Considerations

Future browser decryption should use stable browser crypto APIs such as Web Crypto. It must not implement custom cryptographic primitives.

AES-GCM compatibility:

- The current simulator envelope uses `AES-256-GCM`, 32-byte keys, and 12-byte nonces.
- Web Crypto supports AES-GCM with 256-bit keys in modern browsers.
- The current envelope stores the nonce in the JSON header as base64url without padding.
- The current envelope stores deterministic associated data in the JSON header.
- The AES-GCM authentication tag is included in the ciphertext bytes, which is compatible with common Web Crypto AES-GCM usage.

Parsing requirements:

- verify the `SRCENC1\n` magic bytes
- read the 32-bit big-endian header length
- reject missing, truncated, oversized, or non-UTF-8 headers
- parse the JSON header
- verify version, scheme, algorithm, key ID, nonce length, and associated data
- pass the exact associated data bytes into AES-GCM decrypt

Associated data requirements:

Decryption must use the same incident ID, stream ID, media type, and positive chunk index that the client used during encryption. If the viewer derives associated data from bundle manifests, it must treat manifest metadata as security-sensitive input and fail closed on mismatches.

Bundle and memory concerns:

The current download format is a ZIP bundle. Browser-side decryption of downloaded bundles requires a ZIP-reading strategy before decrypting the `.enc` entries. Large bundles can be expensive to read fully into memory. Future design should consider:

- file-by-file processing instead of whole-bundle buffering
- worker-based decryption to avoid blocking the page
- progress and cancellation UI
- size limits and browser memory failure handling
- clearing raw keys and plaintext references where practical
- avoiding plaintext logging, debug globals, URL parameters, or DOM leaks

Live stream considerations:

Completed bundles and live streams may need different handling. Live chunks may need a stream/session key model, partial manifests, reconnect behavior, key rotation, and a way for late contacts to obtain the right wrapped keys.

## Authorised Access UX

A future browser flow should support both urgent trusted-contact access and non-urgent account-owner review.

Possible urgent flow:

1. The trusted contact opens an incident link.
2. The viewer validates the token or future access grant and shows incident status.
3. The contact provides or already has a decryption capability.
4. The dashboard shows live status, latest checkin, and location if available.
5. Completed encrypted bundles can be downloaded and decrypted locally.
6. Decrypted output can be saved locally or viewed through a carefully designed plaintext handling path.
7. If live streaming exists, the viewer decrypts live chunks using a separate stream/session key model.

Possible non-urgent review flow:

1. The account owner opens an interaction record or evidence note.
2. The viewer makes clear that no emergency escalation is implied.
3. The user decrypts locally, adds notes, and chooses whether to export or share.
4. Sharing/export actions remain separate from capture and review.

Failure handling matters. If decryption fails, the viewer should distinguish safe, user-actionable causes without leaking secrets:

- missing decryption capability
- wrong contact key
- revoked or expired viewer token
- unsupported envelope version
- associated data mismatch
- corrupted or incomplete bundle
- browser compatibility or memory failure

The viewer should still show token-authorized metadata when decryption fails, as long as the token remains valid and the design allows metadata visibility.

## Threat Model Impacts

Stolen viewer token:

A stolen token grants read access to the token-scoped incident viewer and encrypted bundles. It should not grant decryption unless the attacker also has a decryption capability or a future design deliberately makes the token carry one.

Stolen decryption fragment or capability:

Anyone with both the viewer token and the decryption capability may decrypt the relevant evidence. Fragment-carrying links and recovery files must be handled as secrets.

Compromised browser:

A compromised browser, browser profile, extension, or local device can capture tokens, keys, decrypted plaintext, downloads, and screenshots. Browser-side decryption does not protect against this.

Compromised backend:

A passive backend compromise may still be unable to decrypt media without keys. An active backend compromise can serve malicious JavaScript, alter manifests, omit chunks, block access, or attempt to capture browser-entered keys.

Malicious JavaScript:

Malicious JavaScript can read URL fragments, imported keys, wrapped-key plaintext after unwrap, media keys, decrypted chunks, and DOM-visible plaintext. This is the main limit of same-origin browser decryption.

Compromised trusted contact device:

If the contact device or contact private key is compromised, the attacker may decrypt any evidence available to that contact. Contact revocation can limit future wrapping but cannot erase already downloaded data.

Network attacker with HTTPS:

TLS should protect tokens, encrypted bundles, and viewer assets in transit against ordinary network attackers. A network attacker with a compromised CA, compromised reverse proxy, or endpoint control may still attack the flow.

Logs and referrers:

Viewer tokens in paths are sensitive. Decryption material should not be sent in paths or query strings. `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, no-store responses, and reverse-proxy log redaction remain important.

Screenshots and browser history:

Viewer links, fragment keys, decrypted evidence, and dashboard metadata can leak through screenshots, screen sharing, history behavior, clipboard managers, downloads, and local file previews.

## Recommended Direction

Use a phased approach.

Phase 1: document browser decryption constraints.

Keep this document and the key custody document clear that browser decryption is future work and does not weaken the current ciphertext-only backend.

Phase 2: simulator/browser-compatible envelope verification.

Verify that the current simulator envelope can be parsed and decrypted with browser-compatible AES-GCM semantics in a standalone prototype. Do not add production viewer decryption yet.

Phase 3: static proof-of-concept viewer for downloaded bundles.

Build a local or static prototype that imports a simulator key file, parses a downloaded encrypted bundle, and decrypts chunks locally. Keep it separate from the production incident viewer until the trust model is accepted.

Phase 4: trusted contact key wrapping.

Design and prototype contact public keys, wrapped media keys, key IDs, revocation behavior, and contact-key loss handling. This should align with [key-custody.md](key-custody.md).

Phase 5: live stream/session key model.

Define how live chunks, reconnects, late contact enrollment, stream key rotation, and partial manifests work before adding browser live decryption.

The live or partial stream access boundary is documented separately in
[live-partial-stream-access-boundary.md](live-partial-stream-access-boundary.md).

Phase 6: production browser viewer decision.

Decide whether the browser viewer is acceptable as the main trusted-contact UX, or whether a separate trusted contact app or offline decrypt tool should be the higher-assurance path.

## Open Questions

- Should browser decryption be the first trusted-contact UX, or should a native trusted contact app come first?
- Should a fragment ever carry a raw media key, or only an intermediate wrapping/unwrapping capability?
- How should a future viewer clear or hide URL fragments after import?
- How are contact public keys verified before incidents?
- Should the viewer token and decryption capability be delivered separately?
- What bundle or chunk API shape is needed for memory-safe browser decryption?
- Is a static/signed viewer bundle required before production browser decryption?
- How should decrypted output be displayed or saved without creating surprising plaintext caches?
- What metadata should remain visible when decryption fails?
- How should live stream session keys differ from completed bundle keys?
- What browser versions and platforms are in scope?
- How should browser UX differ for emergency incidents, interaction records, safety checks, and evidence notes?
- What tests are required before browser decryption can be trusted?
