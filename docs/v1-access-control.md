# /v1 Access Control

This document defines the current local access-control boundary for Proofline's
private `/v1` control plane and the future direction for broader product access.
Local username/password accounts and opaque server-side sessions are implemented
for the private API. OAuth, JWT, public account portals, trusted-contact
accounts, notifications, browser decryption, key escrow, and server-side
decryption are not implemented.

## Summary

The current `/v1` API is private and requires a local account session for
write/admin routes. First-admin bootstrap, login, and private health/readiness
routes are the narrow unauthenticated exceptions. It remains intended only for
localhost, LAN, WireGuard, firewall, or strict private reverse-proxy access.
Local sessions reduce accidental unauthenticated access; they do not make `/v1`
a public product API.

Future trusted-contact access, incident modes, notifications, production key
custody, browser/client-side decryption, and optional break-glass access all need
explicit role and grant boundaries before any broad public API exposure. This
document keeps those boundaries visible without choosing an external identity
provider.

## Goals

- Preserve the current private `/v1` boundary even with local account sessions.
- Separate account-owner, trusted-contact, public-link, admin/operator, and
  optional escrow access.
- Split future non-admin product API routes from a separately bound private
  admin API listener.
- Keep the public incident viewer read-only and separate from public product API
  routes and private admin routes.
- Distinguish access to metadata, ciphertext, wrapped keys, raw keys, and
  plaintext.
- Define token, session, grant, revocation, and audit expectations for current
  private auth and future implementation work.
- Keep incident-mode, key-custody, deployment, security-model, and threat-model
  docs aligned around one future access-control direction.

## Non-Goals

- No public exposure of the current private `/v1` API.
- No OAuth, JWT, public account portal, broad CSRF framework, or
  identity-provider implementation.
- No web-client, iOS-client, Android-client, or protocol implementation.
- No push notification, SMS, Messenger, email, or emergency-services
  integration.
- No backend decryption, browser decryption, key escrow, key-sharing, or
  break-glass implementation.
- No public admin dashboard.
- No claim that Proofline is production-ready public infrastructure.

## Current Boundary To Preserve

Today the backend has two listener groups:

| Listener group | Current routes | Exposure |
|---|---|---|
| Private API | `/v1/...` with local account/session auth, except bootstrap, login, and private health/readiness routes; private `/admin` web surface with login/bootstrap/logout forms, account list, password forms, and admin session cookie | Localhost, LAN, WireGuard, firewall, or strict private reverse proxy only. |
| Public incident viewer | `/i/{token}` plus legacy `/e/{token}` aliases and `/static/...` | Public HTTPS/reverse proxy may expose this read-only viewer. |

All current `/v1` write/admin routes remain private. The implemented local auth
model has admin and user roles, incident ownership, hashed password storage,
hashed session-token storage, session expiry, logout, account password change,
admin account creation, and admin session revocation. Reverse-proxy rate
limiting, separate bind addresses, and private network placement are useful
boundaries, but they are not a public authorization model.

The private `/admin` surface is outside the `/v1` API namespace but remains on
the private listener. Its login and bootstrap forms reuse the same local account
and server-side session store, with the raw session token held in an HttpOnly
SameSite cookie scoped to `/admin`. The authenticated dashboard lists local
accounts and supports current-admin password changes plus admin password resets
for other local accounts. Authenticated state-changing forms use a
session-bound CSRF token. The token-neutral CSS under `/admin/static/...` is
unauthenticated because it contains no incident data, tokens, keys, or
deployment details.

## Future Listener Topology

Future implementation should avoid treating `/v1` as one public control plane.
The intended topology is separate listener groups with separate route trees.
The target `8080` main API/viewer and `8081` private admin-dashboard split is
documented in
[main API public exposure listener split](public-api-listener-split.md):

| Listener group | Future route scope | Exposure |
|---|---|---|
| Public product API | Account-owner, capture-device, trusted-contact, incident, upload, sharing, account-owner public-link grant issuance/revocation, and key-wrapping delivery routes that are safe for public authenticated access after implementation. | Public HTTPS only after authentication, authorization, abuse controls, and audit behavior exist. |
| Private admin API | Operator/admin health, migration, support, abuse response, operational review, and optional deployment management routes. | Own listener and route tree, configurable for loopback, LAN, WireGuard, VPN, firewall, or private reverse proxy access. Still authenticated and authorized. |
| Public incident viewer | Read-only incident viewer routes and token-neutral static assets. | Public HTTPS/reverse proxy when exposed. |
| Optional escrow or break-glass API | Higher-trust emergency-access or server-assisted key access routes, if ever implemented. | Disabled by default; separate explicit configuration, strong authentication, audit, rate limiting, and deployment warnings. |

Private network placement is not an authentication substitute. Even when the
private admin API is reachable only over a VPN or WireGuard interface, every
admin/operator route should still authenticate the operator and authorize the
requested action. Public product API routes should not expose admin/operator
actions.

## Access Roles

Future implementation should use explicit roles or equivalent grant types. A
single actor may hold more than one role, but authorization checks should reason
about the role used for the current action.

| Role | Purpose | Default access direction |
|---|---|---|
| Account owner | The person who owns the incident record, devices, contacts, and sharing policy. | May create and manage their own incidents, contacts, grants, retention choices, and exports after authentication. |
| Capture device | A device or client acting for an account owner during recording or upload. | May create incidents, streams, checkins, and encrypted chunk uploads only for the owning account and authorized incident. |
| Trusted contact | A person pre-authorized by the account owner or an explicit escalation policy. | May access selected incident metadata, encrypted bundles, and wrapped key material only according to a grant or escalation policy. |
| Public link | A bearer-link viewer capability for one incident, similar to the current incident viewer token. | Read-only, incident-scoped, time-bound where practical, and not a general account or `/v1` credential. |
| Admin/operator | A deployment or service operator responsible for health, support, migration, and abuse response. | Should not casually access user safety data, raw tokens, raw keys, plaintext, or uploaded bytes. Administrative access must be least-privilege and audited. |
| Optional escrow actor | A separately configured break-glass or dead-man-switch actor or policy. | Disabled by default; may access wrapped keys, raw keys, or plaintext only if an explicit future escrow mode is implemented and audited. |

## Data Classes

Authorization must distinguish what kind of data is being accessed. A grant to
read incident metadata is not automatically a grant to decrypt media.

| Data class | Examples | Access expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Public viewer shell | Static assets and token-neutral viewer UI | Publicly reachable when served by the incident viewer. |
| Incident metadata | Incident status, stream state, timestamps, checkins, chunk counts, non-secret display metadata | Role-scoped; public-link access remains incident-scoped and read-only. |
| Ciphertext evidence | Encrypted chunks and encrypted ZIP bundles | Role-scoped; access to ciphertext alone does not imply decryption capability. |
| Wrapped key material | Media keys encrypted to contacts, devices, recovery methods, or escrow modes | Returned only to roles authorized for that wrapping target and incident. |
| Raw keys | Media keys, contact private keys, escrow keys, key shares | Never logged; never exposed in default mode; only possible in an explicit future break-glass mode. |
| Plaintext | Decrypted audio, video, notes, transcripts, or exports | Out of scope for the current backend; any future plaintext path requires separate design, audit, retention, and deployment warnings. |

## Route Exposure Direction

The future control plane should use explicit exposure classes. Route names below
describe policy shape; they are not implementation commitments.

| Route class | Future exposure | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Current `/v1` write/admin routes and private `/admin` web routes | Private only with local account/session authentication. | Includes bootstrap, login/logout, account/password routes, admin account routes, `/admin` account-list and password forms, incident creation, stream creation, chunk upload, checkins, close/fail/complete actions, incident-token creation/revocation, and private chunk reads. |
| Public product API routes | Public-authenticated only after account/device/contact authz, upload abuse controls, request-size controls, and audit are implemented. | Should cover non-admin product flows: account-owner incidents, capture uploads, trusted-contact access, account-owner public-link grant issuance/revocation, sharing, and wrapped-key delivery. |
| Public-link viewer routes | Public read-only viewer routes can remain separate from the public product API. | Current `/i/{token}` and `/e/{token}` paths are bearer-token URLs and must not become write or admin routes. |
| Private admin API routes | Own private listener and route tree, authenticated and authorized even when bound only to VPN, WireGuard, LAN, loopback, firewall, or a private proxy. | Should be narrow, audited, and safe for support without exposing evidence contents, raw tokens, raw keys, or plaintext by default. |
| Escrow/break-glass routes | Not present by default. | Require explicit configuration, policy, audit, warnings, strong authz, and separate implementation. They must not be part of the normal public product API. |

Do not mount admin, operator, escrow, or break-glass routes on the public product
API listener or the public incident viewer listener. Do not mount unauthenticated
write, account, contact, admin, or escrow routes on any listener.

## Authentication Expectations

The current private API uses local username/password accounts, bcrypt password
hashing, and opaque bearer session tokens. Raw session tokens are returned only
to the client and stored only as hashes. Sessions expire and can be revoked.

The first admin account is created through a one-time bootstrap flow:

- the server fails closed at startup when no admin account exists and
  `SAFE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` is not configured
- `POST /v1/bootstrap/admin` requires the bootstrap secret in
  `X-Proofline-Bootstrap-Secret`
- bootstrap is disabled after an admin account exists
- operators should remove the bootstrap secret after creating the first admin

A future public product API may choose cookie sessions, delegated identity,
device-bound credentials, or another reviewed mechanism. That choice must be
made in a separate task with tests and deployment guidance.

Authentication must provide:

- stable actor identity for current local accounts, and for future account
  owners, trusted contacts, capture devices, and operators
- credential expiry and rotation
- revocation for lost devices, removed contacts, leaked links, and operator
  access changes
- replay and token-theft risk analysis
- CSRF protection for browser-cookie flows that perform state-changing actions;
  the current private `/admin` authenticated state-changing forms use a
  session-bound token
- avoidance of raw credential logging, including Authorization headers and
  token-bearing URLs
- clear handling for offline or intermittent capture devices

The private admin API should use authentication and authorization that is at
least as strict as the public product API. A VPN, firewall, private bind
address, or reverse-proxy allowlist can reduce exposure, but it must not be the
only admin identity check.

Public-link bearer tokens are not a general authentication system. They should
remain scoped to a single incident, read-only, and revocable.

## Authorization Expectations

Authorization should be deny-by-default and checked close to the operation being
performed. Current implementation binds local account ID, role, and incident
owner. Current private incident routes also pass route-level action and
data-class labels, but all current incident actions share the same
owner-or-admin policy. Future policy should also bind:

- actor or device identity
- account owner
- incident ID
- role or grant type
- requested action
- incident mode and escalation policy, when implemented
- grant expiry, revocation, and state
- key-access scope, if wrapped keys or escrow access are involved

Authorization decisions should not rely only on route prefix, listener address,
or client-provided account or incident IDs. Repository or service-layer code
that reads or mutates incident data should receive already-authorized scope, or
perform an equivalent check before returning data.

## Grant And Token Lifecycle

Future implementation should separate durable account identity from
incident-scoped grants.

Expected grant types:

- account-owner sessions or device credentials
- capture-device upload authorization
- trusted-contact access grants
- public-link viewer tokens
- optional operator support grants
- optional break-glass or escrow grants

Lifecycle requirements:

- grants should have explicit creation time, actor, scope, and purpose
- grants should have expiry where practical
- explicit no-expiry grants should be visible and reviewable
- revocation should take effect for future requests
- raw token values should be returned only at creation time when bearer tokens
  are used
- stored token material should be hashed or otherwise protected where practical
- grant state should distinguish active, expired, revoked, superseded, and
  consumed one-time grants where applicable
- deleting or removing a trusted contact should stop new access and new key
  wrapping, but older wrapped keys need separate revocation semantics

Viewer-token and session-token lifecycle rules from the current implementation
are a useful starting point: store only token hashes, return raw tokens only at
creation or login time, apply expiry, and make expired, revoked, and invalid
viewer tokens indistinguishable to the public viewer.

## Incident Mode Policy

Incident type labels must not silently imply authorization. Future incident
modes should attach explicit escalation and sharing policies.

Expected defaults:

| Incident mode | Access-control default |
|---|---|
| Emergency incident | May grant urgent trusted-contact access only under an explicit policy. |
| Interaction record | Private by default; sharing and export should be deliberate account-owner actions. |
| Safety check | May grant trusted-contact access after a missed check-in only under an explicit missed-check-in policy with cancellation and grace-period rules. |
| Evidence note | Private by default unless explicitly shared or exported. |

Proofline should not claim that emergency services were contacted unless a
future jurisdiction-specific integration is explicitly implemented and
documented. Trusted contacts should receive enough context to decide what to do,
but the backend should not collapse capture, sharing, decryption, export, and
emergency response into one implicit action.

## Key Custody And Decryption Boundary

Access control and key custody are related but separate.

Default future direction:

- clients encrypt media before upload
- the backend stores ciphertext chunks
- the backend may store wrapped or encrypted copies of media keys
- trusted contacts receive wrapped key material only when authorized
- decryption happens client-side or contact-side where practical
- the server does not store raw media keys in default mode

Optional server escrow or server-side decryption is a separate high-trust mode.
It must be disabled by default or separately configured, audited, rate-limited,
documented with deployment warnings, and implemented only after an explicit
security-sensitive task.

An actor allowed to download encrypted bundles is not automatically allowed to
obtain wrapped keys. An actor allowed to obtain wrapped keys is not necessarily
allowed to obtain raw keys or plaintext.

## Audit And Logging Expectations

Future access-control implementation should add auditability without turning
logs into another copy of sensitive evidence.

Useful audit fields may include:

- timestamp
- action type
- actor ID, contact ID, device ID, or operator ID
- role or grant type
- incident ID
- grant ID or policy version
- decision or outcome
- non-sensitive reason category

Audit logs must not include:

- raw viewer tokens or incident tokens
- raw access tokens, session tokens, refresh tokens, or Authorization headers
- request bodies
- uploaded bytes
- plaintext
- raw keys, key shares, or recovery phrases
- private deployment details
- object-storage credentials, bucket names, private endpoints, or object keys
- unnecessary user safety data

Public issue drafts, support tickets, chat transcripts, screenshots, and
operator dashboards must also avoid raw tokens, keys, plaintext, request bodies,
uploaded bytes, and private deployment details.

## Migration Path

The migration from the current private deployment model should be incremental:

1. Keep all current `/v1` routes private and authenticated with local sessions
   unless the route is explicitly bootstrap, login, `/v1/health/live`, or
   `/v1/health/ready`.
2. Define device, trusted-contact, public-link, operator, and optional
   escrow data model requirements in a protocol/client design task.
3. Introduce separate future route groups for public product API, private admin
   API, and public incident viewer behavior in design and tests before changing
   exposure.
4. Extend authentication and authorization behind private deployments first,
   without changing public exposure.
5. Add audited grant lifecycle behavior for incident-scoped access.
6. Add a separately bound private admin API listener before adding operator or
   admin routes, and require admin authentication even for VPN-only deployments.
7. Update security, threat, API, deployment, and operational docs before any
   public-authenticated product API route is exposed.
8. Expose only the smallest public-authenticated product route set needed for a
   concrete client milestone.
9. Keep public incident viewer routes read-only and separate from public product
   API and private admin API routes unless a later design deliberately replaces
   them.

Any step that changes key custody, wrapped-key delivery, browser decryption,
server escrow, or server-side decryption must also update the key-custody,
browser-decryption, break-glass, security-model, threat-model, encryption, and
deployment docs before or alongside implementation.

## Implementation Prerequisites

Before any public product API exposure or separately bound private admin API
implementation, a future implementation task must define and test:

- concrete authentication mechanism for the new exposure class
- authorization policy and role/grant model beyond the current local user/admin
  roles
- contact, device, and incident ownership data model beyond current incident
  owner account IDs
- session, token, or grant storage and revocation behavior beyond current local
  sessions and viewer tokens
- upload abuse controls and rate-limiting expectations
- CSRF and browser credential rules, if browser sessions are used
- audit log schema and redaction rules
- migration behavior for existing incidents and viewer tokens
- deployment guidance for reverse proxies, TLS, logs, VPN/private admin
  binding, public product API exposure, and listener separation
- tests proving public product API, private admin API, and public incident
  viewer listener separation
- tests proving denied cross-account, cross-incident, and non-admin-to-admin
  access

## Open Questions

- Should the first public-authenticated upload path use account-owner sessions,
  device credentials, or short-lived incident upload grants?
- Should current incident viewer tokens remain long-term, or become a legacy
  compatibility layer after account-based viewer access exists?
- How should contact grants interact with contact-wrapped media keys when a
  trusted contact is removed?
- Which metadata can trusted contacts see before decryption or escalation?
- Should operator support ever read incident metadata, or only health and
  storage integrity state?
- Should the private admin API live under a distinct route prefix, a distinct
  port only, or both?
- Should optional escrow access exist in the first production release, or wait
  until contact-wrapped keys are proven?
- How should authorization decisions be represented in future protocol or
  conformance tests?
