# Codex Prompt: Security Review

Review the backend and documentation for security issues.

Do **not** add new features.
Do **not** add React, Node, npm, OAuth, JWT, user accounts, SMS, Messenger, push notifications, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, cloud integrations, or public admin dashboards.
Do **not** include sensitive vulnerability details in public-facing docs or issue drafts.

## Source of truth

Before making changes, read current source-of-truth files as relevant:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- relevant files in `docs/`
- relevant source files
- relevant tests
- relevant issue or PR, if this is issue/PR work

Do not rely on stale assumptions from this prompt if the repository has changed.
## Global constraints

- Keep changes scoped to the task.
- Do not add unrelated features.
- Do not weaken security warnings.
- Do not claim production readiness.
- Do not expose `/v1` publicly.
- Do not log raw tokens, request bodies, uploaded bytes, Authorization headers, plaintext, raw keys, or future token-like values.
- Do not add React, Node, npm, OAuth, JWT, user accounts, SMS, Messenger, push notifications, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, cloud integrations, or public admin dashboard features unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer Go standard library where practical.
- Preserve private/public listener separation.
- Preserve the current backend ciphertext-only implementation unless the task explicitly concerns key custody, emergency access, or decryption design.
- Do not introduce backend decryption, raw server-held decryption keys, key escrow, browser decryption, or key-sharing behaviour as an incidental implementation detail.
- Any key custody/decryption change must be an explicit security-sensitive task that updates the threat model, security model, encryption docs, tests, and operational guidance before or alongside implementation.
- Future production key custody should assume the iPhone may be unavailable; keys must not exist solely on the client device.
- Server storage of wrapped/encrypted keys may be acceptable if explicitly designed.
- Raw server-side key access or server-side decryption may be acceptable only as a deliberate break-glass/dead-man-switch/emergency-access mode with clear access controls, audit expectations, and deployment warnings.

## Review focus

Check:

- public route surface
- private `/v1` write/admin route exposure
- public/private mux separation
- incident token generation
- token hashing
- token expiry and revocation
- raw token logging
- token leakage through URLs/referrers/logs
- request body / uploaded bytes / Authorization header logging
- upload size limits
- SHA-256 verification
- temp file cleanup
- chunk overwrite prevention
- SQLite constraints
- migration safety
- media stream completion validation
- uploads to completed/failed streams
- ZIP bundle download authorization
- ZIP path traversal
- ZIP entry name sanitization
- filesystem path exposure
- download response headers
- `Cache-Control: no-store`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- CSP / frame protection
- HTML template escaping
- panic/log leakage
- Docker bind exposure risks
- reverse-proxy/TLS assumptions
- simulator key file handling
- key file `.gitignore` coverage
- no raw keys in logs, docs examples, ZIP bundles, or SQLite unless explicitly designed
- no accidental backend decryption, key escrow, browser decryption, key sharing, or undocumented key custody changes
- AEAD associated-data consistency, if encryption code changed
- nonce/key misuse risks in docs/tests
- stale documentation that overpromises production readiness

## Sensitive finding handling

If you find a likely vulnerability that should not be public:

- do not write exploit details into a public issue draft
- do not include raw tokens, secrets, private deployment details, or user safety data
- recommend following `SECURITY.md`
- if this task creates notes, put sensitive notes in a clearly marked private draft location

## Output format

Return findings with severity:

- Critical
- High
- Medium
- Low
- Informational

For each finding, include:

- what is wrong
- why it matters
- minimal recommended fix
- affected files/routes if known
- whether it is safe for public issue tracking

If fixes are needed, make only minimal fixes and run:

```bash
cd server
gofmt -w .
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```
